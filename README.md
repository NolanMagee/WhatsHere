Map + Tweet. (called What's Going on Here?)
Have a map display using Google Maps API.
When User clicks a location, display the most popular Tweet (using Twitter API) within specified range of location (default 100km).
optional: Find other popular things within that range, most popular recent News Article, maybe most popular Instagram post or Reddit post or Flickr image.

Plan:
1. Add Google Maps API
2. Get Maps Display
3. Get location information from user's click (coordinates, cities within range)
4. Add other APIs: Twitter, News
5. Find out how to use location data to get info from those specific areas. (May have to just find cities mentioned,
or country. And filter through all data. May use mongo atlas, or AWS, or Heroku (heroku supposed to be easiest for beginners))
6. Display on a feed the data retrieved


Start with just 1 API: Twitter or News, and implement more after.
