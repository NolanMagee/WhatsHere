This app displays information about any location that you click on using an interactive map

Currently displays weather, news, and a local Tweet

This is very much an early work in progress: buggy and without styling

The backend for the Twitter API is actually the TwitterBot repository on my Github. It is a Google Firebase Cloud Function that handles the Oauth work so I just have to call my own API with the geolocation data.
